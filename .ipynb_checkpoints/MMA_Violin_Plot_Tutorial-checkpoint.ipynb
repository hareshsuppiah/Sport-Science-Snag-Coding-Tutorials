    "This tutorial recreates the violin plots from Barley et al. (2025) studying the influence of height and reach on fight-ending punches in the UFC. You'll learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate realistic MMA fighter data\n",
    "- Create violin plots with box plot overlays\n",
    "- Understand the statistical patterns in the visualisations\n",
    "- Apply these techniques to sports science data\n",

    "\n",
    "**Hook Punches:**\n",
    "- Relatively balanced distribution around zero\n",
    "- Slight advantage for fighters with longer reach\n",
    "- Most common punch type in the dataset\n",

    "- Biomechanically logical - shorter fighters can get under taller opponents\n",
    "- Smallest sample size but clear pattern\n",

    "**Straight Punches:**\n",
    "- Positive median values suggest taller fighters with longer reach have advantages\n",
    "- Aligns with expectations - longer reach improves straight punch effectiveness\n",
    "- Large sample size provides confidence in this pattern\n",

    "- Biomechanically logical - shorter fighters can generate more upward power\n",

    "- **Fight strategy**: Coaches can use this data to develop game plans\n",
    "- **Matchmaking**: Understanding physical matchups helps predict fight dynamics\n",

    "\n",
    "You've successfully created professional violin plots for sports science analysis. Next steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Sports Scientists:\n",
    "- Apply this to your own combat sports data\n",
    "- Analyse other physical attributes (weight, leg reach, etc.)\n",
    "- Compare different fighting styles or weight classes\n",
    "- Study temporal trends in fighting techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Data Analysts:\n",
    "- Adapt the violin plot code for any categorical vs continuous analysis\n",
    "- Use the statistical testing framework for your own datasets\n",
    "- Experiment with different colour schemes and styling\n",
    "- Combine with other plot types for comprehensive analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### For MMA Enthusiasts:\n",
    "- Analyse your favourite fighters' physical attributes\n",
    "- Predict fight outcomes based on physical matchups\n",
    "- Create similar analyses for other combat sports\n",
    "- Share insights with the MMA community\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Resources:\n",
    "- **Matplotlib documentation**: https://matplotlib.org/\n",
    "- **Seaborn tutorials**: https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html\n",
    "- **Pandas for data analysis**: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/\n",
    "- **Sports analytics with Python**: Various online courses and books\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "1. **Violin plots** are excellent for showing both distribution shape and summary statistics\n",
    "2. **Physical attributes** can significantly influence fighting effectiveness\n",
    "3. **Different techniques** favour different body types\n",
    "4. **Data visualisation** is crucial for understanding complex relationships\n",
    "5. **Statistical testing** helps validate our visual observations\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have the skills to create professional sports science visualisations. The world of sports data contains many fascinating insights waiting to be discovered."
