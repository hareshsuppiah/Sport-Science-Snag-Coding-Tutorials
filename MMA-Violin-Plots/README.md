# MMA Violin Plots Tutorial

A beginner-friendly tutorial for creating professional violin plots in sports science, based on Barley et al. (2025) research on height and reach advantages in UFC fighting.

## Quick Start

**Google Colab (Recommended):**
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hareshsuppiah/Sport-Science-Snag-Coding-Tutorials/blob/main/MMA-Violin-Plots/MMA_Violin_Plot_Tutorial.ipynb)

**Or download:** `MMA_Violin_Plot_Tutorial.ipynb` and run in Jupyter

## What You'll Learn

- Generate realistic MMA fighter data
- Create violin plots with box plot overlays  
- Understand statistical patterns in the visualisations
- Interpret physical advantages in combat sports
- Export data and plots for further analysis

## Tutorial Structure

1. **Data Understanding** - Learn about height/reach differences in MMA
2. **Data Generation** - Create realistic pseudo data matching the study
3. **Statistical Exploration** - Calculate basic statistics by punch type
4. **Violin Plot Creation** - Build publication-quality visualisations
5. **Results Interpretation** - Understand what the plots reveal
6. **Data Export** - Save your work for future use

## Key Findings

The tutorial replicates findings showing:
- **Hooks**: Balanced distribution (no clear advantage)
- **Overhand**: Shorter fighters have advantages
- **Straight**: Taller fighters with longer reach have advantages  
- **Uppercut**: Shorter fighters have advantages

## Requirements

- No prior coding experience needed
- Uses standard Python libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Runs in any Python environment
